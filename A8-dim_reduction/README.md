## Assignment 8 : Using arcene data, compare dimensionality reduction methods

>- https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Arcene
>- Apply PCA, kernel PCA, Isomap, LLE
>  - Dim=[10,50,100]
>  - For kernel PCA, Isomap, and LLE, you have to apply them simultaneously on train and validation sets
>- Apply k-NN classifier with k=5
>  - Train as train, validate as test
>  - Calculate accuracy of validation set
>- Apply k-NN classifier with k=5 on reduced datasets
>  - Train as train, validate as test
>  - Calculate accuracy of validation set
>- Compare results
