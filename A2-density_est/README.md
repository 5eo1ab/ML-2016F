### Assignment 2

1. Implement density estimation using cosine kernel without scikit-learn package

>- User data D={2,3,4,8,10,11,12}
>- Set h=1
>- Draw plot for estimated probability density (like the figure in Example: Parzen-Window Density Estimation)

2. Implement kernel smoothing with epanechnikov kernel

>- Use kernel_smoothing_test.txt for data
>- Set h=1
>- Compare results from kernel smoothing using Gaussian kernel and epanechnikov kernel
>  - Draw figures in the similar way you exercised during class
