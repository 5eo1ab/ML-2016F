## Assignment 3 : Build bagging based on k-NN classifier

1. Build BaggingClassifier based on k-NN classifier

  >- Use iris data
  >- Set k=1, n_estimators=3
  >- Draw the final decision boundary
  >- Draw decision boundary each k-NN classifier trained from subsampled data by BaggingClassifier

2. Build BaggingRegressor based on k-NN regressor

  >- Randomly generate data with the same method used in class
  >- Set k=3, n_estimators=[10,30,50]
  >- Draw similar figure in the lecture note
